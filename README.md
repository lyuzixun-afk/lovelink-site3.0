# LoveLink — Smart Dating Platform (Course Prototype)

This repository contains a **fully static** prototype that satisfies the assignment's "basic model" requirements:

- Home page
- User registration & login
- User catalog (browsing + filters by age / gender / interests)
- Matching system (simple score + Like + Match → Chat)
- Real‑time chat (local demo with a playful bot; no server required)
- Feedback & Reviews
- About us
- Contact us

Everything runs in the browser using `localStorage` — perfect for a class demo or GitHub Pages.

## How to run

1. Download and unzip this project.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. Click **Seed demo users** on the Home page for quick testing.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new public repo and upload the files.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, select the `main` branch / root.
3. Wait 1–2 minutes; your site URL will be shown.

## Notes

- This is a front‑end only demo. For a production app you would add a backend (auth, database, real-time chat via WebSocket).
- Data privacy: all demo data stays **only** in your browser. Use dummy accounts in class.
- License: MIT. Feel free to modify for your assignment.
